# hello-world

Hello, this is my first creation with github. I am currently a 2021 freshman in my second semester, and I am still a beginner in code.

As far as languages go, I currently know python, java, and a small amount of visual basic. I also have a small amount of experience in web deveopment, and cloud-computing with aws.
